# The-Golden-Taste-Buffet-Public

Description: This responsive website was fully created during my time as a full-stack developer for ‘The Golden Taste Buffet’. Users experience an animated landing page, view the gallery of menu items, place or cancel a reservation which is confirmed through an automatic email, and obtain contact information regarding the buffet. As well, they can create an account through a login/logout system to make the process of reserving a table even more seamless. These reservations are stored in a sqlite3 database. This website is hosted using Heroku.
